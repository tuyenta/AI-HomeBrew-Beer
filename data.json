Don\u2019t panic if temperatures get over 90\u00b0 F! Biere de Garde yeast can be finicky sometimes and just quit fermenting if you try to cool the temperature. Once fermentation is complete, transfer to secondary. For best results, age your beer in or on red wine oak barrels or oak chips. The touch of red wine character gives the beer a lovely, subtle character that works well with the yeast and hop characteristics. Allow beer to age for at least 8 weeks, perhaps up to 12 weeks, bringing the temperature down to 45-50\u00b0 F for the last 2-3 weeks. After aging, simply continue with bottling/kegging as usual.\nBrewer\u2019s note: this beer requires patience and attention to temperature! Sure, let the fermentation temperature go as high as it wants, but then follow the aging program above for the best results. Biere de Garde is a funny yeast to work with, but its results can be beautiful. In fact, this is the perfect beer to brew in December, bottle in February, and drink in March. Cheers!\n"

Carbonate to 2.5-2.6 volumes CO2 and enjoy!\nFor fun, you can dry hop or add fruit to this beer. Roadhouse Brewing has done both! If fruiting, we recommend adding fruit during fermentation to ensure all sugars are consumed before packaging. If dry hopping, pick your favorite and go light, as this is a delicate beer and a little goes a long way!\n"
